# Deep Learning for Sports Performance Analysis: A Computer Vision Approach

##  Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation and related resources for our research project **"Deep Learning for Sports Performance Analysis: A Computer Vision Approach"**, which explores the application of advanced deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of sports performance evaluation through computer vision.

As competitive sports continue to evolve towards data-driven strategies, there is a growing demand for intelligent systems capable of processing multimodal, high-frequency data in real time. Our approach addresses the limitations of conventional methods — such as reliance on handcrafted statistical models and limited scalability — by proposing an end-to-end framework powered by advanced deep learning and computer vision technologies.


##  Objectives

- Utilize deep learning to extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional sports data.
- Improve performance evaluation through visual tracking, biomechanical analysis, and game context understanding.
- Propose an interpretable, scalable solution for both real-time analysis and strategic coaching support.



##  Key Components

- **Dynamic Performance Predicted Model (DPPM)**: 
  - Fuses real-time motion capture, physiological signals, and tactical positioning using deep probabilistic modeling and data integration.
  
- **Adaptive Game Strategy Optimization (AGSO)**: 
  - Learns domain-specific decision strategies to enhance coaching effectiveness and in-game decision making.
  
- **Computer Vision Techniques**:
  - High-precision pose estimation
  - Action recognition and segmentation
  - Visual tracking of athlete motion and interaction


##  Experimental Results

We conducted extensive evaluations on real-world sports datasets, demonstrating:

- Superior prediction accuracy compared to baseline models
- Real-time performance
- Strategy adaptability
- High relevance and interpretability of the e
